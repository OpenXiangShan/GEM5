# About

This is the gem5 simulator for Xiangshan (XS-GEM5), which
currently scores similar with Nanhu on SPEC CPU 2006.
XS-GEM5 is enhanced with

- Xiangshan RVGCpt: a cross-platform full-system checkpoint for RISC-V.
- Xiangshan online Difftest: an API to check execution results online.
- Frontend microarchitecture calibrated with Xiangshan V2 (Nanhu): Decoupled frontend, TAGESC, and ITTAGE,
which performance better than LTAGE and TAGE-SCL shipped in official version on SPECCPU.
- Instruction latency calibrated with Nanhu
- Cache hierarchy, latency, and prefetchers calibrated with Nanhu.
- A fixed Multi-Prefetcher framework with VA-PA translation support
- A fixed BOP prefetcher
- Parallel RV PTW (Page Table Walker) and walking state coalescing
- Cascaded FMA
- Move elimination
- L2 TLB and TLB prefetching (coming soon).
- Other functional or performance bug fixes.

# A Short Doc

### GCC & libboost

- Use GCC > 9.4.0.
- Install libboost.

## Build GEM5

```shell
cd gem5
scons build/RISCV/gem5.opt --gold-linker
export gem5_home=`pwd`
```

## Produce RVGCpt checkpoints with NEMU

Please refer to [the checkpoint tutorial for Xiangshan](https://xiangshan-doc.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/tools/simpoint/)
and [Build Linux kernel for Xiangshan](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan-doc/blob/main/tutorial/others/Linux%20Kernel%20%E7%9A%84%E6%9E%84%E5%BB%BA.md)

The process of SimPoint checkpointing includes
- SimPoint Profiling to get BBVs.
- SimPoint clustering. You can also opt to Python and sk-learn to do k-means clustering.
- Taking checkpoints according to clustering results.

If you have problem generating SPECCPU checkpoints, following links might help you.

## Difftest with NEMU

The Difftest framework used in XS-GEM5 is similar to the one used in Xiangshan.
Please use the [gem5-ref-main branch of NEMU](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/NEMU/tree/gem5-ref-main) for difftest with XS-GEM5.

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/NEMU.git -b gem5-ref-main
cd NEMU
export NEMU_HOME=`pwd`
make riscv64-nohype-ref_defconfig
make menuconfig  # then save configs
make -j 10
```

Then the contents of `build` directory should be 
```
build
|-- obj-riscv64-nemu-interpreter-so
|   `-- src
`-- riscv64-nemu-interpreter-so
```

then use `riscv64-nemu-interpreter-so` as reference for GEM5,
``` shell
export ref_so=`realpath build/riscv64-nemu-interpreter-so`

# This is not full command, but a piece of example.
$gem5_home/build/gem5.opt ... --enable-difftest --difftest-ref-so $ref_so ...
```


## DRAMSim3

Refer to [The readme for DRAMSim3](ext/dramsim3/README) to install DRAMSim3.

Notes:
- Must rebuild gem5 after install DRAMSim3
- Must use DRAMSim3 with our costumized config

`$gem5_home/build/gem5.opt ... --mem-type=DRAMsim3 --dramsim3-ini=$gem5_home/xiangshan_DDR4_8Gb_x8_2400.ini ...`

## Default command to run

see [The example running script](util/warmup_scripts/simple_gem5.sh)
